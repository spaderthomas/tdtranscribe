- Load a song from the filesystem or from MP3
- Saving and loading projects
  - Where do the save files go? 
  - How do I make sure the user has to do nothing besides load an MP3? 
  - What if they change the path to the file -- should it still load the same project?
  - Can I just serialize the redux store? 
- Add the top menu
  - Save a project
  - Load a project
- Training
  - Create a 'cutscene' on first boot to show how to use it?
  - Make a YouTube video 
- Allow you to select multiple sub-regions to loop
  - This could be useful in other ways. For example, if you could rectangle
    select regions, or shift-click them, you could batch edit their color. 
- Pick a color pallet
- Let you add notes for each region.
- A slider to slow down or speed up the music. 
- Licensing
  - How do I do a perpetual fallback license?
  - How do I do feature-lock in a way that isn't crackable? Is this possible
    with JS?

really cool shit:
- ability to make musical flash cards. phrases, licks, or scales you need to
  practice
- turn a region into a musical flash card
- spaced repetition

- quickly record audio snippets.
- integrate audio snippets with flash cards?
- integrate with icloud?1 

* done
- press escape to cancel creating a region

ok....this isn't working. spending WAY too much time just trying to wrestle this
thing to work. what is the problem? it's not debuggable. and the random memory
leaks...christ, the random memory leaks. 

the problem with the effects and dependencies is that it's too easy to trigger
an infinite loop.

i would love it if the regions were NOT globals

but shit needs to know about them. for example, the region viewer. a notes
editor. 

maybe i can separate out the stuff that only the waveform needs to know? get rid
of a few render cycles like that?
